## Why a fresh chat?

AI tools are great at helping you *build* plans. They're bad at *critiquing* them — because the same model that helped develop an idea has a natural bias toward defending it. Researchers call this **sycophancy**: the tendency to agree with whatever the user seems to want ([Anthropic, 2024](https://www.anthropic.com/news/visible-extended-thinking)).

The fix is simple: **the reviewer must not be the author.** Finish your plan in one conversation, then paste it into a brand new chat for critique. The fresh context eliminates anchoring bias — the reviewer has zero knowledge of your reasoning, compromises, or earlier drafts.

---

## When this is worth doing

- Grant proposals and funding applications
- Project implementation plans
- Research designs and pre-analysis plans
- Hiring plans, restructurings, major purchases
- Any decision where the cost of a bad plan exceeds the 10 minutes this takes

**Skip for:** grocery lists, reversible decisions, plans you'll iterate on daily anyway.

---

## The method

**1. Finish your plan.** Get it to a state where you think it's ready — in any tool, on paper, wherever.

**2. Copy it with enough context.** Include: the goal, deadline, available resources, key constraints, stakeholders involved, and what success looks like. A 3-sentence sketch produces a shallow review. Aim for 200+ words with concrete steps.

**3. Open a new chat** in Claude.ai, ChatGPT, or any tool. Do not continue in the conversation where you built the plan.

**4. Paste the prompt below, then paste your plan** at the bottom where indicated.

**5. Read the critique, then iterate.** Fix critical issues first. Ask follow-up questions. For high-stakes plans, open *another* fresh chat and run a second review from a different angle.

---

## The prompt

Copy this into your fresh chat, then paste your plan at the bottom:

```text
You are an external reviewer, not a collaborator. Your job is to find
problems, not to encourage.

Stress-test this plan. For each issue, point to the specific step or
sentence that triggered your concern. Classify each finding as:
- MUST FIX — will likely cause failure or major rework if not addressed
- WORTH CONSIDERING — creates risk, but the plan can proceed if you
  decide consciously to accept it

Find:
1. The top 3 ways this plan could fail — work backward from failure
2. What's missing that someone experienced in this domain would expect
   (stakeholders, dependencies, resources, sequencing issues)
3. What assumptions or timelines look unrealistic — and what evidence
   would confirm or refute them
4. What should change before proceeding

If domain-specific best practices matter, search for them and cite
what you find.

Do not rewrite the plan. Diagnose first.

End with a verdict: PROCEED or REVISE FIRST.

THE PLAN:
[paste here]
```

!!! tip "Use the strongest thinking model on your plan"
    Heavier reasoning models produce sharper critique. Pick the most capable model available on your subscription — the adversarial framing in this prompt does the rest.

---

## What to do with the output

**If the verdict is REVISE FIRST:** Address the "Must Fix" items. Then ask: *"Here's my revised plan addressing your concerns. Review it again."*

**If the verdict is PROCEED:** Scan the "Worth Considering" items. Decide consciously which risks you're accepting and which are worth a quick fix.

**For high-stakes plans** (grants, major hires, large budgets): Open a second fresh chat with a modified role — *"Review this plan as a [budget analyst / regulatory expert / field operations manager]."* Different personas catch different blind spots. For maximum independence, use separate conversations rather than asking for multiple personas in one chat.

---

## Common mistakes

**Reviewing in the same conversation where you built the plan.** The model will hedge its criticism because it participated in creation. Always use a fresh chat.

**Trusting the verdict without reading the findings.** The classification is a starting point. Read each finding and decide for yourself whether it applies to your situation. AI reviewers can be overconfident about risks that don't apply to your context ([ScienceDirect, 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581925002149)).

**Using a plan that's too vague.** A 3-sentence sketch gets a 3-sentence review. Include concrete steps, timelines, resources, and constraints.

**Adopting the AI's revision wholesale.** When you ask for a revised plan, the model produces something plausible and polished. Resist adopting it without thinking. The revision is a starting point, not a replacement for your judgment ([PMC, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10546443/)).

## Save this for repeat use

If you review plans regularly, save the prompt as a persistent project instead of pasting it each time.

### Claude.ai Project

1. Go to [claude.ai/projects](https://claude.ai/projects) (requires Pro, Team, or Enterprise)
2. Click **"+ New Project"**
3. Name it **"Plan Reviewer"**
4. Click **"Set Custom Instructions"** and paste the prompt from above
5. Optionally upload reference documents (your org's project standards, past post-mortems, domain checklists)

To use: open the project, start a **new conversation** each time, paste your plan. The instructions apply automatically. Each new conversation gets fresh context — no cross-contamination between reviews. ([Claude Help Center — Projects](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9519177-how-can-i-create-and-manage-projects))

### ChatGPT Custom GPT

1. Go to [chatgpt.com/create](https://chatgpt.com/create) (requires Plus, Team, or Enterprise)
2. Click the **Configure** tab
3. Set name: **Plan Reviewer**; paste the prompt into Instructions
4. Enable **Web Browsing**; disable DALL-E and Code Interpreter
5. Save → choose **"Anyone with a link"** to share with colleagues

To use: start a new conversation with the GPT each time. Colleagues can use it immediately via the shared link — no setup on their end. ([OpenAI — Creating a GPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8554397-creating-a-gpt))

### Tips for both

- **Always start a new conversation** for each plan — reusing an old conversation reintroduces the anchoring problem
- Keep a versioned copy of your instructions in a local text file with dates and change notes
- Test with one plan you know is solid and one you know has problems before sharing with colleagues
