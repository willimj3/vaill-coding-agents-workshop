# Downloads & Reference Library

Guides, templates, and reference documents from my actual setup. Download, adapt, and use freely.

**A note on dates:** AI tools evolve fast. Each resource includes a date so you know how current it is. I'll update these periodically, but always check official documentation for the latest on any specific tool.
