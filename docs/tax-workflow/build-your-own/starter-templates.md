# Starter Templates

Downloadable skill skeletons and templates you can adapt for your own document-collection and compilation workflows. These are generic — they use the [architecture patterns](architecture-patterns.md) from the tax workflow but are not tax-specific.

!!! tip "How to use these"
    Copy the template that matches your use case. Replace the bracketed fields with your domain-specific content. Save as a `.md` file in `~/.claude/commands/`. See the [Skill Library](../../setup/skill-reference.md) for installation details.

## Template 1: Document Collector

A skill that searches email for documents, downloads them, and tracks completeness. Adapted from the tax collection skill but generalized for any document type.

??? example "Full template — click to expand"

    ````markdown
    # /[domain]-collect — [Domain] Document Collection

    *v1.0 — [date] — Initial version*

    Search Gmail for [document type] documents. Download, rename,
    extract key data, and track completeness.

    ## Arguments

    - `period:[value]` — Collection period (default: [sensible default])
    - `scan-only` — Preview findings without downloading

    ## Prerequisites

    - Gmail MCP connected
    - Document folder exists at `[path]/[period]/`
    - Tracking checklist exists at `[path]/[period]/CHECKLIST.md`

    ## Instructions

    ### Step 1: Load Configuration

    1. Parse arguments. Set `DOC_DIR` = `[path]/[period]/`
    2. Read `DOC_DIR/CHECKLIST.md`
    3. Display current status dashboard

    ### Step 2: Search Gmail

    Run these searches in parallel:

    #### 2a: Broad keyword search
    ```
    "[keyword1] OR [keyword2] OR [keyword3]" after:[start] before:[end]
    ```

    #### 2b: Known sender search
    For each sender in [known sender list]:
    ```
    from:[sender] after:[start]
    ```

    #### 2c: Catch-all search
    ```
    "[broader terms]" after:[start] before:[end]
    ```

    ### Step 3: Present Findings

    For each email with a potential document:
    ```
    ──────────────────────────────────────
    Document [N] of [Total]
    ──────────────────────────────────────
    From: [sender]
    Subject: [subject]
    Date: [date]
    Attachment: [filename] or "No attachment"

    Document type: [classification]
    Already collected? [Yes/No]

    [D] Download  [S] Skip  [Q] Quit
    ──────────────────────────────────────
    ```

    ### Step 4: Download and Process

    For each approved download:
    1. Download attachment via Gmail MCP
    2. Rename to consistent format: `[Type] - [Source].[ext]`
    3. Extract key fields: [list fields relevant to your domain]
    4. Display extracted data for user verification
    5. Update CHECKLIST.md

    ### Step 5: Summary Dashboard

    ```
    This session: Downloaded [N], Skipped [M]
    Total collected: [X] of [Y]
    Still missing: [list]
    ```

    ### Step 6: Gap Analysis

    Compare current collection against prior period.
    Flag any sources present last period but missing now.

    ## Error Handling

    - Gmail MCP unavailable: Exit with message
    - Download fails: Offer skip or retry
    - Document unreadable: Flag for manual review

## Template 2: Compilation Skill with Guided Interview

A skill that compiles data from multiple sources through a structured interview. Adapted from the Schedule C compilation pattern.

??? example "Full template — click to expand"

    ````markdown
    # /[domain]-compile — [Domain] Data Compilation

    *v1.0 — [date] — Initial version*

    Compile [output type] from collected documents and user input
    through a guided interview.

    ## Arguments

    - First argument: sub-command (`[cmd1]`, `[cmd2]`, `review`, `all`)
    - `period:[value]` — Period to compile (default: [default])

    ## Sub-commands

    | Sub-command | What it does | Data source |
    |-------------|-------------|-------------|
    | `[cmd1]` | [description] | Guided interview + collected documents |
    | `[cmd2]` | [description] | [external source] export |
    | `review` | Period-over-period comparison | Current + prior outputs |
    | `all` | Run [cmd1] + [cmd2] sequentially | |

    ## Instructions

    ### Setup

    1. Parse sub-command and period argument
    2. Set `DOC_DIR` = `[path]/[period]/`
    3. Verify documents exist

    ### Sub-command: [cmd1]

    #### Step 1: Pull Data from Collected Documents

    Read [document type] and extract [fields].
    Display for verification:
    ```
    [CATEGORY] (from collected documents):
      [Source 1]: [value]
      [Source 2]: [value]
      TOTAL: [sum]

    Verify correct? [Y/edit/n]
    ```

    #### Step 2: Reference Prior Period

    Display prior period's [output type] for context.

    #### Step 3: Guided Interview

    Walk through each [category type]:
    ```
    ──────────────────────────────────────
    CATEGORY [N] — [DESCRIPTION]
    ──────────────────────────────────────
    Prior period: [amount]
    Prompts: [domain-specific questions]

    Enter items. Type "done" when finished.
    Type "skip" if none. Type "same" to copy prior.
    >
    ```

    #### Step 4: Generate Output

    Create `[Output Name].xlsx` with:
    - Tab 1: Summary (category totals)
    - Tab 2: Detail (all line items)
    - Tab 3: Entry guide (mapped to downstream system)

    #### Step 5: Verification

    Display summary. Compare to prior period.
    Flag anomalies (>15% change, sign reversals, missing categories).

    **STOP: User must approve before finalizing.**

    ## Error Handling

    - Missing documents: Show what's available, note gaps
    - External source unavailable: Offer manual entry fallback

## Template 3: Multi-Period Review

A skill that compares the current period's output against prior periods to catch anomalies.

??? example "Full template — click to expand"

    ````markdown
    # /[domain]-review — [Domain] Period Comparison

    *v1.0 — [date] — Initial version*

    Compare current period against [N] prior periods.
    Flag anomalies and generate action items.

    ## Arguments

    - `periods:[N]` — Number of prior periods to compare (default: 2)

    ## Instructions

    ### Step 1: Locate Period Files

    Search for output files in:
    ```
    [path]/[current]/  → [filename or "not found"]
    [path]/[prior-1]/  → [filename or "not found"]
    [path]/[prior-2]/  → [filename or "not found"]
    ```

    ### Step 2: Extract Key Metrics

    Read all period files in parallel. Extract:

    | Metric | [P-2] | [P-1] | [Current] |
    |--------|-------|-------|-----------|
    | [Metric 1] | | | |
    | [Metric 2] | | | |
    | [Metric 3] | | | |

    ### Step 3: Anomaly Detection

    For each metric, flag:
    - Change > [threshold]%
    - Sign reversal
    - Missing in current but present in prior
    - New in current but absent from prior

    Display with severity:
    ```
    !! [Metric]: [value change] — [investigation guidance]
    !  [Metric]: [value change] — [note]
    ```

    ### Step 4: Action Items

    Based on flags, generate:
    - Items to verify before finalizing
    - Items to investigate (may indicate errors)
    - Items to note (expected changes)

!!! note "Provider portability"
    These templates assume Gmail MCP for email search. If you use Outlook, Yahoo, or another email provider, you'll need to adapt the search step — currently there is no equivalent MCP for non-Gmail providers. The compilation and review templates work with any email provider since they operate on local files.

## Non-Tax Examples

To make these templates concrete, here's how they adapt to other domains:

### Expense Reporting
- **Collector:** Search email for receipts, vendor confirmations, travel confirmations
- **Compiler:** Categorize by project, expense type, and policy limit
- **Reviewer:** Compare against budget forecast and prior month

### Grant Reporting
- **Collector:** Gather subaward invoices, timesheets, purchase receipts
- **Compiler:** Map expenses to grant budget categories, calculate burn rate
- **Reviewer:** Compare against award budget and reporting milestones

### Insurance Claims
- **Collector:** Find EOBs, claim statements, provider bills
- **Compiler:** Reconcile billed vs. allowed vs. paid amounts
- **Reviewer:** Track claim status and flag denied claims for appeal

### Annual Faculty Review
- **Collector:** Gather publications, grant awards, teaching evaluations, service records
- **Compiler:** Organize into activity report categories
- **Reviewer:** Compare against prior year and department benchmarks
