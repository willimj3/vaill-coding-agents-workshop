# Install Claude Code (Mac)

**A beginner's guide for Terminal newcomers. No prior command-line experience needed.**

---

## What Is Claude Code?

You have probably used Claude through a web browser at claude.ai -- type a question, get an answer. Claude Code is the same Claude, but running in **Terminal** instead of your browser.

**Why does that matter?**

| Claude.ai (browser) | Claude Code (Terminal) |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| You copy/paste files into the chat | Claude reads files directly from your computer |
| You copy/paste code back out | Claude edits files directly |
| Limited to what you type or upload | Can search your folders, run scripts, send emails |
| Isolated from your workflow | Integrated into your workflow |

Think of it this way: Claude.ai is like texting a smart friend. Claude Code is like having that friend sit at your computer with you.

---

## Prerequisites

- **A Mac** (Windows? See [Install -- Windows](install-windows.md))
- **Internet connection**
- **Anthropic account** -- If you have used Claude.ai, you already have one. If not, you will create one during setup.

---

## Step 1: Open Terminal

### What is Terminal?

Terminal is a text-based interface to your computer. Instead of clicking on folders and files, you type commands. It looks old-fashioned, but it is powerful -- and it is how Claude Code runs.

You do not need to become a Terminal expert. You just need to know how to open it and type a few commands.

### How to open Terminal

1. Press **Cmd + Space** to open Spotlight search
2. Type **Terminal**
3. Press **Enter**

A window will appear with a blank screen and a prompt that looks something like:

```
yourusername@your-mac ~ %
```

The `%` (or sometimes `$`) is where you type commands.

**Do not panic at the blank screen.** Terminal is just waiting for you to tell it what to do.

---

## Step 2: Install Node.js

### Why you need this

Claude Code is built using a technology called Node.js. Think of Node.js as the engine that runs the Claude Code program. Without it, Claude Code cannot start.

### How to install

1. Open your web browser and go to: **https://nodejs.org**
2. You will see two download buttons. Click the **LTS** version (LTS means "Long Term Support" -- it is the stable, reliable version)
3. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the prompts (click Continue, Agree, Install)
4. When it finishes, go back to Terminal

### Verify it worked

In Terminal, type this command and press Enter:

```bash
node --version
```

You should see a version number like `v20.11.0` or similar. The exact number does not matter -- what matters is that you see a version, not an error.

**If you see an error:** Close Terminal completely and reopen it, then try again. The installer sometimes requires a fresh Terminal window.

---

## Step 3: Install Claude Code

This downloads Claude Code from Anthropic's servers and installs it on your computer. You only do this once.

In Terminal, type this command and press Enter:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**What to expect:** You will see text scrolling by -- this is normal. It is downloading and installing files. Wait until you see your prompt (`%` or `$`) appear again, meaning it is done.

This may take a minute or two depending on your internet connection.

!!! ask-claude "Stuck? Ask Claude."
    If you have already started Claude Code (Step 4 below), you can type your problem
    directly in the Claude Code terminal -- for example:
    `I got a permission error when installing. Can you help?`
    Press Enter. Claude can see the context of your session and usually knows what went wrong.

!!! tip "Permission errors?"
    If you see permission errors, try running the command with `sudo` in front:
    ```bash
    sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
    ```
    You will be asked for your Mac password. When you type it, no characters will appear (this is a security feature) -- just type your password and press Enter.

---

## Step 4: First Run and Authentication

The first time you run Claude Code, you need to link it to your Anthropic account. This is a one-time setup.

In Terminal, type:

```bash
claude
```

And press Enter.

**What happens next:**

1. Your web browser will open automatically
2. You will see an Anthropic login page
3. Log in with your Anthropic account (or create one if needed)
4. Click "Approve" or "Authorize" when asked to give Terminal access
5. Return to Terminal -- you should see a welcome message

**You are in.** Claude Code is now running.

---

## Step 5: Your First Conversation

Once Claude Code is running, you will see a prompt where you can type messages. Just type like you would in any chat:

```
> What files are in my current folder?
```

Press Enter, and Claude will respond -- but now Claude can actually look at your files and tell you what is there.

!!! ask-claude "Not sure what to do first?"
    In the Claude Code terminal, try typing:
    `I just installed Claude Code. I'm a law professor who teaches Contracts and writes about regulatory compliance. What's the most useful thing I can do in the next 10 minutes?`
    Press Enter. Claude will walk you through getting started based on your role.

### Useful to Know

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Send a message | Type and press **Enter** |
| Multi-line message | Press **\\** then **Enter** for a new line without sending |
| Queue a message while Claude works | Just type -- it will be sent when Claude is ready |
| Scroll through past messages | **Up/Down** arrow keys |
| Get help | Type `/help` |
| Exit | Type `/exit` or press **Ctrl + C** |

---

## Step 6: Opening Claude Code Again

After the first-time setup, you do not need to repeat Steps 1-4. From now on:

### Starting a new session

1. Open Terminal (Cmd + Space -> "Terminal" -> Enter)
2. Type `claude` and press Enter

That is it.

### Where you start matters

Claude Code pays attention to **which folder you are in** when you start it. If you are working on a specific project, navigate to that folder first:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/article-draft
claude
```

This way Claude can see and work with the files in that project.

### Resuming a previous session

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `claude -c` | **Continue** -- picks up your most recent conversation in the current folder |
| `claude --resume` | **Resume** -- shows a list of recent conversations so you can choose which one |

**`claude -c`** is the one you will use most. You were working on something, you closed Claude Code, and now you want to keep going.

---

!!! tip "What Claude Code can access"
    Claude Code can read any file in the folder where you run it -- and, if asked, files elsewhere on your machine, including cloud-synced folders (Dropbox, iCloud, Google Drive). It can also run terminal commands. This is what makes it powerful: Claude works *with* your files, not in a separate sandbox. When Claude reads a file or processes data, that content is sent to Anthropic's API. Anthropic's [data policy](https://www.anthropic.com/policies/privacy) states API inputs are not used for model training. For more on data handling, see [Privacy](../privacy.md).

## What's Next

You have installed Claude Code and had your first conversation. The recommended next steps:

1. **[Set up your CLAUDE.md file](claude-md.md)** -- This tells Claude about you, your courses, your research, and your preferences so every session starts with context. (~30 minutes)

2. **[How Claude Code Thinks](../setup/index.md#how-claude-code-thinks)** -- Understand the three modes that control Claude's behavior (Default, Plan, Auto-Accept). (~5 minute read)

3. **[Connect external services](mcp-setup.md)** -- Give Claude access to Gmail, Google Docs, or Calendar so it can help with real tasks. (~30-60 minutes)

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Open Terminal | Cmd + Space -> "Terminal" -> Enter |
| Check Node.js | `node --version` |
| Install Claude Code | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| Start Claude Code | `claude` |
| Continue last session | `claude -c` |
| Resume a past session | `claude --resume` |
| Get help | `/help` |
| Exit | `/exit` or Ctrl+C |

---

## Troubleshooting

**`node: command not found`** -- Close Terminal and reopen it. If that does not work, reinstall Node.js from nodejs.org.

**`npm: command not found`** -- Same fix as above. npm comes with Node.js.

**Permission errors during install** -- Use `sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` and enter your Mac password.

**Browser doesn't open for authentication** -- Copy the URL from Terminal and paste it into your browser manually.

**Claude Code feels slow** -- The first response in a session can take a few seconds as it loads context. Subsequent responses are faster.
