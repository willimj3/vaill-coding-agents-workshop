# Prompt Engineering

<span class="badge-teal">No Claude Code required</span>

Prompt engineering sounds technical. It isn't. It's the skill of asking AI tools for what you actually want, in a way that gets useful results on the first try.

This page covers prompt engineering as a repeatable method you can apply to any task.

!!! tip "The single most important thing on this page"

    Don't memorize prompt engineering rules — **make the AI do it for you.**
    Create a Project in [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) or
    [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai), paste in the instructions below, and it
    will restructure your messy input into clean prompts automatically.

    The same idea works for plan review: paste a plan into a
    [fresh chat with an adversarial prompt](../workflows/plan-review-browser.md)
    and get structured critique — no coding needed. In Claude Code, the
    [`/prompt` skill](../workflows/first-session-skills.md#step-1-structure-your-thinking-prompt)
    formats and executes prompts in a single command.

## Why This Matters

The gap between a mediocre AI interaction and a great one is almost always the prompt. Not the model, not the subscription tier, not some secret technique. Just how clearly you communicated what you wanted.

Good prompts share three properties:

1. **They provide context** — enough background that the AI doesn't have to guess
2. **They specify the task** — unambiguously, in 1-2 sentences
3. **They define the output** — format, length, tone, audience

Most bad interactions fail on #1 (no context) or #3 (no output specification).

## The Anatomy of a Good Prompt

Here's a real prompt with each section labeled. Not every prompt needs all six parts — but knowing them lets you diagnose why a prompt isn't working.

=== "Full example (labeled)"

    !!! example "Role"
        You are a senior economics journal referee reviewing a paper for the American Economic Review.

    !!! info "Context"
        I'm writing a grant proposal for a foundation that funds violence reduction programs. The proposal is for a randomized evaluation of a CBT intervention for high-risk youth in a Latin American city. Budget ceiling is $500K over 3 years.

    !!! success "Task"
        Draft the methodology section (800-1000 words). Focus on the randomization strategy, primary outcomes, and power calculations.

    !!! warning "Constraints"
        - Keep it under 1000 words
        - Academic but accessible — like a top-5 journal, not a textbook
        - Don't include a literature review — that's a separate section
        - Focus on identification strategy. Spend less time on implementation details.

    !!! quote "Output Format"
        Structure as: (1) Design overview, (2) Randomization, (3) Outcomes and measurement, (4) Power and sample size. Use short paragraphs. No bullet points — this is narrative prose.

    !!! tip "Bookend"
        Remember: the goal is a methodology section for a foundation grant, not a journal paper. Keep the tone accessible and emphasize the practical implementation plan.

=== "Just the prompt (copy-paste)"

    ```text
    You are a senior economics journal referee reviewing a paper
    for the American Economic Review.

    I'm writing a grant proposal for a foundation that funds violence
    reduction programs. The proposal is for a randomized evaluation
    of a CBT intervention for high-risk youth in a Latin American
    city. Budget ceiling is $500K over 3 years.

    Draft the methodology section (800-1000 words). Focus on the
    randomization strategy, primary outcomes, and power calculations.

    Constraints:
    - Keep it under 1000 words
    - Academic but accessible — like a top-5 journal, not a textbook
    - Don't include a literature review — that's a separate section
    - Focus on identification strategy over implementation details

    Structure as: (1) Design overview, (2) Randomization,
    (3) Outcomes and measurement, (4) Power and sample size.
    Use short paragraphs. No bullet points — narrative prose.

    Remember: the goal is a methodology section for a foundation
    grant, not a journal paper. Keep the tone accessible and
    emphasize the practical implementation plan.
    ```

### The six sections explained

**1. Role** (optional) — Tell the AI what perspective to take. Useful when you need domain expertise. Skip for simple tasks — "You are a helpful assistant" adds nothing.

**2. Context** — What does the AI need to know? Who you are, what you're working on, relevant constraints, what you've already decided.

**3. Task** — The core ask in 1-2 clear sentences. Front-load this — don't bury it after three paragraphs of context.

**4. Constraints** — What should the AI do or avoid? Be specific: "Keep it under 1000 words" not "be concise." Include exclusions and priorities.

**5. Output Format** — How should the result be structured? Sections, length, tone, style.

**6. Bookend** (for long prompts) — Restate the key instruction at the end. AI models sometimes lose focus on long inputs.

## Match Effort to Stakes

Not every task needs the same level of effort. A quick email reply doesn't need the AI to "research best practices" and "state assumptions." A methodology review does.

**Three levels:**

| Level | When to Use | What to Add |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Light** | Quick tasks, routine emails, simple lookups | Nothing extra — just format clearly |
| **Standard** | Analysis, research writing, design decisions | Ask for assumptions and rationale: *"Include key assumptions (2-3 bullets) and brief rationale for major choices."* |
| **Deep** | High-stakes writing, methodology, pre-analysis plans | Ask for verification: *"Research current best practices. Compare your approach against established standards. Flag where you deviate and why."* |

**Default to Light.** Upgrade when the stakes justify it.

---

## Use Examples (But Try Without Them First)

Examples are one of the most powerful prompting techniques — but they're also overused. The rule of thumb: **try without examples first.** If the output format or style is wrong, tighten your instructions or add an output schema. Only add examples if that still fails.

When examples help most:

- You need a specific format Claude doesn't know (a custom report template, your organization's style)
- You want consistent voice across multiple outputs
- Describing the format in words would take longer than showing it

When you probably don't need them:

- Standard formats (emails, summaries, bullet lists) — Claude already knows these
- Tasks where you want Claude to suggest the best approach rather than match a template

When you do use examples, keep them compact. `input → output` pairs work better than verbose multi-paragraph samples. Two good examples beat five mediocre ones.

---

## Use Tags to Separate Instructions from Content

When you paste a long document into a chat, the AI can confuse your instructions with the document text. Simple tags fix this:

When a prompt has multiple types of content — instructions, background data, documents to analyze — XML-style tags help Claude parse what's what.

```text
<instructions>
Summarize the key findings from this paper. Focus on methodology
and results. Keep it under 300 words.
</instructions>

<paper>
[Full paper text pasted here...]
</paper>

<output_format>
Three sections: (1) Method, (2) Key findings, (3) Limitations.
</output_format>
```

Without tags, Claude has to figure out where your instructions end and the document begins. With tags, there's no ambiguity. You don't need tags for short, simple prompts — they're most useful when you're mixing instructions with pasted content.

---

## Break Complex Tasks into Steps

A prompt that asks for a literature review, methodology section, budget narrative, and timeline will produce mediocre versions of all four. Break complex tasks into a sequence of focused prompts where each step builds on the previous one.

**Single prompt (works for simple tasks):**

> Analyze this dataset, identify trends, and write an executive summary.

**Chained approach (better for complex work):**

> *Prompt 1:* Analyze this dataset and identify the 5 most significant trends. For each, explain the evidence.
>
> *[Review output, then...]*
>
> *Prompt 2:* Based on those trends, write a 2-paragraph executive summary for a non-technical audience.

Chaining works because you can course-correct between steps. If Prompt 1 misses something, you fix it before Prompt 2 builds on bad foundations. This matters most for research, analysis, and creative work — anything where direction might shift based on intermediate results.

---

## Common Anti-Patterns

**Vague thoroughness language.** "Be comprehensive" and "be meticulous" are empty calories. Replace with specific verbs:

- "Compare against [specific standard]"
- "Research current best practices for [domain]"
- "Flag where your approach deviates from [benchmark]"

**Over-prompting.** Modern AI models are good at following instructions. You don't need `CRITICAL: YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY...` — a calm, specific directive works better. Shouting in all-caps doesn't make the AI try harder. In fact, [Anthropic's prompt engineering guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering) specifically warns that anti-laziness prompts like "be thorough" and "think carefully" can cause newer models to overthink and waste time.

**No pushback permission.** If you want honest feedback, say so: *"Tell me directly if this approach has problems. Don't just agree with everything."* By default, AI tends toward politeness and agreement.

## Make the AI Do This for You

You don't have to internalize all of the above. Create a project in ChatGPT or Claude.ai with prompt engineering instructions as the project file, and the AI will restructure your messy input into clean prompts automatically.

### Setup

- **ChatGPT** (Plus or Team): Sidebar → Projects → New Project → paste the file below into Instructions.
- **Claude.ai** (Pro): Projects → Create Project → paste into Project Instructions.

=== "Claude.ai"

    In Claude.ai, go to **Projects → Create Project**. Add your instructions and upload files in the right panel:

    ![Claude.ai Projects interface with Memory, Instructions, and Files](../images/claude-projects-v1.png){ alt="Claude.ai Projects interface showing where to add instructions and upload files" }

=== "ChatGPT"

    In ChatGPT, go to **Sidebar → Projects → New Project**. Add files under the **Sources** tab:

    ![ChatGPT Projects interface with Sources and uploaded files](../images/chatgpt-projects-v1.png){ alt="ChatGPT Projects interface showing Sources tab with uploaded instruction files" }

### The instructions file

The instructions tell the AI to take any unstructured input and restructure it into a clean, well-organized prompt. It supports three modes: "quick format" (just the prompt), "format and critique" (prompt + alternatives), and "prompt pack" (2-4 variants at different depth levels).

[:octicons-download-16: Download the instructions](../downloads/prompt-assistant-instructions.md){ .md-button } &nbsp; Copy and paste into your project's instructions field.

Now when you dump a rough idea into this project — dictated, messy, whatever — the AI restructures it into a clean prompt you can paste anywhere.

## Going Further

Once you find prompts that work well for recurring tasks, save them. Replace specifics with `[FILL IN]` placeholders and you have reusable templates.

For a head start, download the **[Prompt Preferences Template](../downloads/prompt-preferences-template.md)** — it captures your standard sections, common constraints, preferred output formats, and roles in one file you can paste into any ChatGPT or Claude.ai project.

When you're ready for more: [Project Folders](project-folders.md) show how to build domain-specific instruction sets, and in Claude Code you can turn templates into *skills* (slash commands) that run with a single command — the [Setup Guide](../setup/index.md) shows how.

### Three levels of saved context

Save context at three levels: [Prompt Preferences](../downloads/prompt-preferences-template.md) for any chatbot, [Project Folders](project-folders.md) for recurring tasks, or [CLAUDE.md](../toolkit/claude-md.md) for Claude Code. Start with #1 and add layers as you need them.
