# Prompt Engineering

<span class="badge-teal">No Claude Code required</span>

Prompt engineering sounds technical. It isn't. It's the skill of asking AI tools for what you actually want, in a way that gets useful results on the first try.

This page covers prompt engineering as a repeatable method you can apply to any task.

!!! tip "The single most important thing on this page"

    Don't memorize prompt engineering rules — **make the AI do it for you.**
    Create a prompt engineering project in ChatGPT or Claude, and it will
    restructure your messy input into clean prompts automatically.

    Once you start using Claude Code, you can automate this further with
    the [`/prompt` skill](../workflows/first-session-skills.md#step-1-structure-your-thinking-prompt) that formats and
    executes prompts in a single command.

## Why This Matters

The gap between a mediocre AI interaction and a great one is almost always the prompt. Not the model, not the subscription tier, not some secret technique. Just how clearly you communicated what you wanted.

Good prompts share three properties:

1. **They provide context** — enough background that the AI doesn't have to guess
2. **They specify the task** — unambiguously, in 1-2 sentences
3. **They define the output** — format, length, tone, audience

Most bad interactions fail on #1 (no context) or #3 (no output specification).

## The Anatomy of a Good Prompt

Here's a real prompt with each section labeled. Not every prompt needs all six parts — but knowing them lets you diagnose why a prompt isn't working.

=== "Full example (labeled)"

    !!! example "Role"
        You are a senior economics journal referee reviewing a paper for the American Economic Review.

    !!! info "Context"
        I'm writing a grant proposal for a foundation that funds violence reduction programs. The proposal is for a randomized evaluation of a CBT intervention for high-risk youth in a Latin American city. Budget ceiling is $500K over 3 years.

    !!! success "Task"
        Draft the methodology section (800-1000 words). Focus on the randomization strategy, primary outcomes, and power calculations.

    !!! warning "Constraints"
        - Keep it under 1000 words
        - Academic but accessible — like a top-5 journal, not a textbook
        - Don't include a literature review — that's a separate section
        - Focus on identification strategy. Spend less time on implementation details.

    !!! quote "Output Format"
        Structure as: (1) Design overview, (2) Randomization, (3) Outcomes and measurement, (4) Power and sample size. Use short paragraphs. No bullet points — this is narrative prose.

    !!! tip "Bookend"
        Remember: the goal is a methodology section for a foundation grant, not a journal paper. Keep the tone accessible and emphasize the practical implementation plan.

=== "Just the prompt (copy-paste)"

    ```text
    You are a senior economics journal referee reviewing a paper
    for the American Economic Review.

    I'm writing a grant proposal for a foundation that funds violence
    reduction programs. The proposal is for a randomized evaluation
    of a CBT intervention for high-risk youth in a Latin American
    city. Budget ceiling is $500K over 3 years.

    Draft the methodology section (800-1000 words). Focus on the
    randomization strategy, primary outcomes, and power calculations.

    Constraints:
    - Keep it under 1000 words
    - Academic but accessible — like a top-5 journal, not a textbook
    - Don't include a literature review — that's a separate section
    - Focus on identification strategy over implementation details

    Structure as: (1) Design overview, (2) Randomization,
    (3) Outcomes and measurement, (4) Power and sample size.
    Use short paragraphs. No bullet points — narrative prose.

    Remember: the goal is a methodology section for a foundation
    grant, not a journal paper. Keep the tone accessible and
    emphasize the practical implementation plan.
    ```

### The six sections explained

**1. Role** (optional) — Tell the AI what perspective to take. Useful when you need domain expertise. Skip for simple tasks — "You are a helpful assistant" adds nothing.

**2. Context** — What does the AI need to know? Who you are, what you're working on, relevant constraints, what you've already decided.

**3. Task** — The core ask in 1-2 clear sentences. Front-load this — don't bury it after three paragraphs of context.

**4. Constraints** — What should the AI do or avoid? Be specific: "Keep it under 1000 words" not "be concise." Include exclusions and priorities.

**5. Output Format** — How should the result be structured? Sections, length, tone, style.

**6. Bookend** (for long prompts) — Restate the key instruction at the end. AI models sometimes lose focus on long inputs.

## Depth Calibration

Not every task needs the same level of effort. A quick email reply doesn't need the AI to "research best practices" and "state assumptions." A methodology review does.

**Three levels:**

| Level | When to Use | What to Add |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Light** | Quick tasks, routine emails, simple lookups | Nothing extra — just format clearly |
| **Standard** | Analysis, research writing, design decisions | Ask for assumptions and rationale: *"Include key assumptions (2-3 bullets) and brief rationale for major choices."* |
| **Deep** | High-stakes writing, methodology, pre-analysis plans | Ask for verification: *"Research current best practices. Compare your approach against established standards. Flag where you deviate and why."* |

**Default to Light.** Upgrade when the stakes justify it.

---

## Use Examples (But Try Without Them First)

Examples are one of the most powerful prompting techniques — but they're also overused. The rule of thumb: **try without examples first.** If the output format or style is wrong, tighten your instructions or add an output schema. Only add examples if that still fails.

When examples help most:

- You need a specific format Claude doesn't know (a custom report template, your organization's style)
- You want consistent voice across multiple outputs
- Describing the format in words would take longer than showing it

When you probably don't need them:

- Standard formats (emails, summaries, bullet lists) — Claude already knows these
- Tasks where you want Claude to suggest the best approach rather than match a template

When you do use examples, keep them compact. `input → output` pairs work better than verbose multi-paragraph samples. Two good examples beat five mediocre ones.

---

## Use XML Tags for Structure

When a prompt has multiple types of content — instructions, background data, documents to analyze — XML-style tags help Claude parse what's what. This is especially useful when you're pasting in text for Claude to work with.

```text
<instructions>
Summarize the key findings from this paper. Focus on methodology
and results. Keep it under 300 words.
</instructions>

<paper>
[Full paper text pasted here...]
</paper>

<output_format>
Three sections: (1) Method, (2) Key findings, (3) Limitations.
</output_format>
```

Without tags, Claude has to figure out where your instructions end and the document begins. With tags, there's no ambiguity. You don't need tags for short, simple prompts — they're most useful when you're mixing instructions with pasted content.

---

## Break Complex Tasks into Steps

A prompt that asks for a literature review, methodology section, budget narrative, and timeline will produce mediocre versions of all four. Break complex tasks into a sequence of focused prompts where each step builds on the previous one.

**Single prompt (works for simple tasks):**

> Analyze this dataset, identify trends, and write an executive summary.

**Chained approach (better for complex work):**

> *Prompt 1:* Analyze this dataset and identify the 5 most significant trends. For each, explain the evidence.
>
> *[Review output, then...]*
>
> *Prompt 2:* Based on those trends, write a 2-paragraph executive summary for a non-technical audience.

Chaining works because you can course-correct between steps. If Prompt 1 misses something, you fix it before Prompt 2 builds on bad foundations. This matters most for research, analysis, and creative work — anything where direction might shift based on intermediate results.

---

## Common Anti-Patterns

**Vague thoroughness language.** "Be comprehensive" and "be meticulous" are empty calories. Replace with specific verbs:

- "Compare against [specific standard]"
- "Research current best practices for [domain]"
- "Flag where your approach deviates from [benchmark]"

**Over-prompting.** Modern AI models are good at following instructions. You don't need `CRITICAL: YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY...` — a calm, specific directive works better. Shouting in all-caps doesn't make the AI try harder. In fact, [Anthropic's prompt engineering guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering) specifically warns that anti-laziness prompts like "be thorough" and "think carefully" can cause newer models to overthink and waste time.

**No pushback permission.** If you want honest feedback, say so: *"Tell me directly if this approach has problems. Don't just agree with everything."* By default, AI tends toward politeness and agreement.

## Make the AI Do This for You

You don't have to internalize all of the above. Create a project in ChatGPT or Claude.ai with prompt engineering instructions as the project file, and the AI will restructure your messy input into clean prompts automatically.

### Setup

- **ChatGPT** (Plus or Team): Sidebar → Projects → New Project → paste the file below into Instructions.
- **Claude.ai** (Pro): Projects → Create Project → paste into Project Instructions.

=== "Claude.ai"

    In Claude.ai, go to **Projects → Create Project**. Add your instructions and upload files in the right panel:

    ![Claude.ai Projects interface with Memory, Instructions, and Files](../images/claude-projects-v1.png){ alt="Claude.ai Projects interface showing where to add instructions and upload files" style="max-width: 480px" }

=== "ChatGPT"

    In ChatGPT, go to **Sidebar → Projects → New Project**. Add files under the **Sources** tab:

    ![ChatGPT Projects interface with Sources and uploaded files](../images/chatgpt-projects-v1.png){ alt="ChatGPT Projects interface showing Sources tab with uploaded instruction files" style="max-width: 480px" }

### The instructions file

Copy this into your project instructions. It tells the AI to take any unstructured input and restructure it into a clean, well-organized prompt.

```text
# Prompt Engineering Assistant — Project Instructions

## Purpose
You are a prompt engineering assistant. Your job is to take narrative,
unstructured input and restructure it into clean, well-organized prompts.

Primary deliverable: a ready-to-paste prompt (or small set of prompt
variants) that reliably produces the user's desired output.

## Default behavior
- Rewrite messy specs into a structured prompt using standard sections
  (Role, Task, Context, Constraints, Output Format, Examples).
- Put instructions before context/data. Use clear delimiters between
  instructions and any quoted input.
- Make implicit requirements explicit. Remove filler while preserving meaning.
- Prefer action verbs and testable requirements over adjectives.
- If something important is missing: proceed with reasonable defaults
  and list them as "Assumptions," or ask a single clarifying question
  only if the missing info would likely change the output substantially.

## Output you produce each time
1. Final Prompt (ready to paste)
2. Suggestions (optional) — improvements, risks, missing info
   - Skipped when the user says "quick format"

## Supported modes
- "quick format" — output only the restructured prompt, no suggestions
- "format and critique" — restructured prompt plus detailed critique
  and 2-3 alternative prompt designs
- "prompt pack" — 2-4 prompt variants (minimal, standard, rigorous)

## Standard prompt structure
Use these headings in order (omit irrelevant sections):

### Role
Include only when starting a new thread or when specialized expertise
changes outputs.

### Task
The single clearest description of what the model must do.

### Context
Background needed to perform the task well.

### Inputs
What the user is providing and how to treat it.

### Constraints
Rules, boundaries, and "do not" instructions. Include scope boundaries
and what to do when uncertain.

### Output format
Exact structure, length targets, style/tone constraints, required elements.

### Examples
Only when examples exist or format is tricky.

### Acceptance criteria
A short checklist that makes success testable.

### Assumptions
Only include if you proceeded without asking a clarifying question.

## Quality checklist before finalizing
- Single main task is unambiguous
- Output format is explicit and easy to grade
- Constraints are not contradictory
- Data is clearly separated from instructions
- Any defaults are documented as assumptions
- Prompt is copy-pasteable and does not depend on hidden context
```

Now when you dump a rough idea into this project — dictated, messy, whatever — the AI restructures it into a clean prompt you can paste anywhere.

## Going Further

Once you find prompts that work well for recurring tasks, save them. A text file, a note on your phone — the format doesn't matter. Over time, replace specifics with `[FILL IN]` placeholders and you have reusable templates. In Claude Code, you can turn those templates into *skills* (slash commands) that run with a single command — the [Get Started](../setup/index.md) path shows how.
