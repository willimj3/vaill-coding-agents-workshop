## What This Is

A free, open-source resource for non-developers who want to build real AI workflows. Three paths:

1. **The Essentials** — Tools and foundations. Chatbots done right, dictation, transcription, prompt engineering.
2. **The Toolkit** — Claude Code setup, configuration, and downloadable skills. From "what is this?" to a working system.
3. **Build Your Own** — Creating custom skills, agents, and self-improving workflows.

## Who It's For

- Academics and researchers managing multiple projects
- Professionals buried in email, meetings, and coordination
- Anyone who wants to move beyond casual chatbot use

No coding background required. Everything is built with markdown and AI tools.
