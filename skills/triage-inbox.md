# Smart Inbox Triage

*v1.3 — Phase 0.5 label-in-inbox sweep; auto-filter creation; clean inbox verification*

Scan your inbox for emails that should be in labeled folders (@ToRead, @Announcements, @School, Expenses-Pending, Auto-Archive, etc.) but are not filtered there yet. Uses header and content heuristics that Gmail's native filters cannot replicate.

## Prerequisites

- **Gmail MCP** — `google_workspace_mcp` with Gmail tools enabled
- **Email policy config** — `~/.claude-assistant/config/email-policy.md` (VIP list, auto-archive rules, filter lists). Download the template from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/chrisblattman/claudeblattman/tree/main/templates) (see First-Time Setup).
- **Triage config** — `~/.claude-assistant/config/triage-config.md` (label IDs, expense vendors, scoring thresholds, classification overrides). Download the template from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/chrisblattman/claudeblattman/tree/main/templates) (see First-Time Setup).
- **Gmail label IDs** — You need the internal Gmail label IDs for each target label. Run `mcp__google_workspace__list_gmail_labels` to find them, then put them in `triage-config.md`.

## First-Time Setup

1. **Create config directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.claude-assistant/config ~/.claude-assistant/state ~/.claude-assistant/logs
   ```

2. **Create `triage-config.md`** from the template. At minimum, fill in:
   - **Label IDs** — run `mcp__google_workspace__list_gmail_labels` with your email to find IDs for your target labels (@ToRead, @Announcements, @School, Expenses-Pending, Expenses-Personal, Expenses-Uncertain, Auto-Archive, @Family, @FYI)
   - **Expense Vendor Domains** — domains like amazon.com, uber.com, etc. that send receipts
   - **Classification Overrides** — senders you always want routed a specific way

3. **Create `email-policy.md`** from the template. At minimum, fill in:
   - **VIP lists** (Tier 1: family, journals, compliance; Tier 2: collaborators, team members)
   - **@Family addresses** — personal contacts who should never be auto-triaged
   - **Auto-Archive rules** — senders or patterns to always archive

4. **Test with preview mode:**
   ```
   /triage-inbox noapply
   ```
   Review the classifications. Adjust config thresholds until results match your expectations.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` can include:
- `noapply` - Preview only, do not apply labels
- `days:N` - Override search window (e.g., `days:3` after a weekend). Default: auto-calculated from last run time (typically 1 day). Falls back to 1 day if no run history exists.
- `limit:N` - Process only first N emails (e.g., `limit:20`)

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Read Policy and Config

Before any classification, read these two files:

1. **Policy**: `~/.claude-assistant/config/email-policy.md`
   - Current VIP list (Tier 1 and Tier 2)
   - @Family addresses
   - Current Auto-Archive rules
   - Skip-inbox label rules

2. **Config**: `~/.claude-assistant/config/triage-config.md`
   - Label IDs for all triage labels
   - Expense vendor domains and routing rules
   - Expense keywords, skip patterns, and detection thresholds
   - Classification score thresholds
   - Classification overrides table
   - Newsletter platform domains, school domains, @ToRead sender whitelist

### Phase 1.5: Label-in-Inbox Sweep

Before processing new emails, sweep for emails already carrying a skip-inbox label that are still in the main inbox. This catches Gmail filter misses (e.g., forwarded email bypass), prior batch_modify failures, and mobile labeling without archiving.

**Single combined search:**
```
mcp__google_workspace__search_gmail_messages
  user_google_email: your-email@gmail.com
  query: "in:inbox (label:@Announcements OR label:@School OR label:@ToRead OR label:@FYI OR label:@ToDo OR label:@ToSelf)"
  max_results: 50
```
If combined query fails, fall back to individual `in:inbox label:X` searches per label.

**Two categories with different handling:**

| Category | Labels | Remove INBOX? | Change read status? |
|----------|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **A — Skip-inbox** (applied by triage/filters) | @Announcements, @School, @ToRead, @FYI | Yes | Yes — mark as read |
| **B — Action** (applied by user manually) | @ToDo, @ToSelf | Yes | No — leave read/unread as-is |

**@Family exclusion:** Do NOT sweep @Family. If your policy prohibits auto-archiving family emails, exclude that label from the sweep. If @Family emails are found in inbox, note count in the report but take no action.

**After archiving:** Log swept message IDs to the run state file with `"label": "Phase0.5-sweep"`. This prevents repeat MCP calls on subsequent runs.

**Report section** (added to the classification report):
```
LABEL-IN-INBOX SWEEP: [N archived]
  Category A (skip-inbox): [N] — @Announcements: N, @School: N, @ToRead: N, @FYI: N
  Category B (action labels): [N] — @ToDo: N, @ToSelf: N
  @Family in inbox (not swept): [N]
```
Count >10 per run suggests recurring batch_modify failures or filter issues — flag for investigation.

**Error handling:** If search fails, log "Phase 1.5 sweep failed — skipping" and continue to Phase 2. Do NOT block the main triage loop.

### Phase 2: Determine Search Window

1. Read `~/.claude-assistant/state/triage-run-state.json`
2. If `last_run` exists:
   - Calculate hours since last run
   - Search window = max(hours_since_last_run + 6 hours buffer, 24 hours)
   - Convert to days for Gmail query: ceiling(window_in_hours / 24)
   - Cap at 7 days maximum
3. If no state file or no `last_run` field: default to 1 day
4. If `days:N` argument provided: use N (overrides everything)

Report: "Search window: [N] day(s) [reason: last run X hours ago / default / manual override]"

### Phase 3: Search Inbox

**Two searches needed:** One for general triage (unread only), one for expense detection (read or unread).

**Use the search window calculated in Phase 2** (referred to as `N` below).

**3a. General triage search** (newsletters, announcements, auto-archive):
```
mcp__google_workspace__search_gmail_messages
  user_google_email: your-email@gmail.com
  query: "in:inbox is:unread newer_than:Nd"
  max_results: 50
```

**3b. Expense detection search** (catches read-but-unlabeled expense emails):
Build the query from the Expense Vendor Domains table in `triage-config.md`. Format:
```
mcp__google_workspace__search_gmail_messages
  user_google_email: your-email@gmail.com
  query: "in:inbox newer_than:Nd (from:domain1 OR from:domain2 OR ...)"
```
Include all domains from the config. Omit `is:unread` so read-but-unlabeled receipts are caught.

**Why two searches:** The general search uses `is:unread` to avoid reprocessing. But expense emails may be read on phone/web before triage runs -- without the second search, they would be missed. The expense search omits `is:unread` so read-but-unlabeled receipts are still caught.

**Merge results:** Combine message IDs from both searches (deduplicate). Emails already labeled with any `Expenses-*` label are filtered out in Phase 7.

### Phase 4: Dedup Against Run State

Read `~/.claude-assistant/state/triage-run-state.json` if it exists. This file tracks message IDs processed in recent runs to prevent duplicate processing on re-runs or partial failures.

For each message ID from Phase 3, check if it appears in the state file with a timestamp less than 7 days old. If found, **skip it** -- it was already processed. Report: "Skipping [N] already-processed emails from previous run."

If the state file does not exist, continue normally (first run).

### Phase 5: Fetch Email Details

Fetch each email individually. Fetch in parallel for speed:
```
mcp__google_workspace__get_gmail_message_content
  user_google_email: your-email@gmail.com
  message_id: [each ID from Phase 3, deduplicated]
```

Extract from each email:
- From address
- Subject
- Date
- Headers (especially List-Unsubscribe if present)
- Body preview (first 500 chars for "unsubscribe" detection)

### Phase 6: Safety Check (VIP Protection)

For each email, check against VIP list from policy file. **SKIP** (leave in inbox) if:
- Sender is on Tier 1 VIP list (family, compliance, journals)
- Sender is on Tier 2 VIP list (collaborators, team members)
- Sender matches @Family addresses
- Sender is from known collaborator domains

### Phase 7: Expense Detection

Before general classification, check each email against expense patterns. Emails flagged as expenses are **excluded from Phase 10** -- they do not get double-classified.

**HARD RULE: Skip emails already labeled with any `Expenses-*` label** (see Label IDs in `triage-config.md`). **Never reclassify.** If an email has `Expenses-Pending`, it was placed there intentionally. Do NOT move it to `Expenses-Personal` or any other label -- the existing label is sacred.

**Note:** Gmail labels are nested as `Expenses/Expenses-Pending` etc. When searching Gmail, use `label:Expenses/Expenses-Pending` (not `label:Expenses-Pending`). Label IDs work correctly for add/remove operations regardless.

**Detection logic:** Apply rules from `triage-config.md` in this order:

1. Check sender against **Expense Vendor Domains** table
2. Check subject against **Expense Subject Keywords** (must also be from vendor-like sender)
3. Apply **Expense Skip Patterns** (NOT expenses even if from vendor domain)
4. Apply any **vendor-specific special handling** rules from the config
5. Apply **Expense Detection Thresholds** for edge cases

**When expense detected:**
- **Route to appropriate label** using the expense routing table in the config
- Apply label, archive, and read-status rules from the config's label application rules table
- **Do NOT classify Business/Personal** -- that is a separate expense-processing step
- **Exclude from Phase 10** -- do not double-classify

### Phase 8: Filter Bypass Recovery

**Problem:** Emails forwarded from a work address sometimes bypass Gmail filters (forwarding alters envelope headers). The filter exists and is correct, but it did not fire.

**Logic:** For each email still in inbox, check if the sender/subject matches any documented filter in `email-policy.md`:
- Auto-Archive Filters table (all stages)
- @ToRead filters
- @Announcements filters
- @School filters

**If match found AND email is still in inbox:**
- Apply the filter's documented action (label + skip inbox + mark read per filter rules)
- Log as `[Filter Bypass] {sender} | {subject} -> {action} (filter exists but did not fire)`
- **Exclude from Phase 10** -- already handled

**Why this happens:** Gmail filters match at delivery time. When a forwarding address alters the envelope sender, `from:` filter matching can fail even though the displayed From: header looks correct. This phase backstops those misses.

**Report section:** In the classification report, show these under a separate heading:
```
FILTER BYPASS RECOVERY: [N]
  - [Sender] | [Subject] | [Expected filter] | Applied: [action]
```

### Phase 9: Calendar Invitation Detection

Before general classification, check each email for calendar invitation signals. Emails detected as calendar invitations are **excluded from Phase 10**.

**Detection signals (any one is sufficient):**
- Message-ID header contains `calendar-` (Google Calendar invitations)
- Subject starts with "Invitation:" or "Updated invitation:"
- Has `invite.ics` or `text/calendar` attachment/content-type
- Subject contains "accepted" or "declined" combined with calendar event patterns

**Exclusions (NOT calendar invitations for this rule):**
- Acceptance notifications from `calendar-notification@google.com` with subject containing "accepted" -- these are typically handled by existing Auto-Archive filters
- Calendly "New Event" notifications -- typically handled by existing filters

**When calendar invitation detected:**
- Classify as **@Announcements** (use Label ID from `triage-config.md`)
- Remove from INBOX, leave **UNREAD**
- Log: `[Calendar] {subject} -> @Announcements`

### Phase 10: Classification Logic

For emails that pass the safety check and are NOT flagged as expenses, filter bypass recovery, or calendar invitations, classify using this decision tree:

```
0. Check overrides FIRST:
   - Does sender match any entry in the **Classification Overrides**
     table in triage-config.md? -> Use that classification directly,
     skip all scoring below.

1. Check headers:
   - Has List-Unsubscribe header? -> Newsletter signal (+2)
   - From address contains "noreply" or "no-reply"? -> Automated signal (+1)
   - From address contains "newsletter" or "digest"? -> Newsletter signal (+1)

2. Check content:
   - Body contains "unsubscribe" (case-insensitive)? -> Newsletter signal (+2)
   - Body contains generic greeting ("Dear colleague", "Dear faculty", etc.)? -> Announcement signal (+1)
   - Subject contains event keywords ("seminar", "workshop", "webinar")? -> Announcement signal (+1)
   - Subject contains "receipt", "confirmation", "order"? -> Auto-archive candidate (+1)

3. Check domain patterns (use tables in triage-config.md):
   - From **Newsletter Platform Domains** table? -> @ToRead (immediate, skip scoring)
   - From **School Domains** table (excluding @Family addresses)? -> @School
   - From .edu domain + event/seminar keywords? -> @Announcements
   - Matches **Auto-Archive Heuristic Patterns** table? -> Auto-Archive candidate

4. Scoring (per Classification Score Thresholds in config):
   - From Newsletter Platform Domain -> @ToRead (already handled in step 3)
   - From @ToRead Sender Whitelist (triage-config.md) -> @ToRead
   - Newsletter score >= 3 (generic signals) -> @Announcements (NOT @ToRead)
   - Announcement score >= 2 + .edu domain -> @Announcements
   - Receipt/notification from noreply -> Auto-Archive candidate
   - Score 1-2 with mixed signals -> UNCERTAIN (skip)
   - Score 0 or no pattern match -> SKIP (leave in inbox)

5. Tiebreaking: If multiple categories match, use the
   **Classification Priority** table in triage-config.md.
```

### Phase 11: Classification Report

Generate report grouped by proposed action:

```
INBOX TRIAGE REPORT
====================
Date: [date]
Emails scanned: [N]
Search window: [N] day(s) ([reason from Phase 2])

PROPOSED CLASSIFICATIONS
------------------------

@ToRead (Newsletters): [N]

The following senders appeared multiple times and could become permanent Gmail filters:
  - [sender@domain.com] -> @ToRead (seen 3x)
  - ...

===
To preview without applying, run: /triage-inbox noapply
```

### Phase 12: Apply Labels

Labels are applied by default after showing the report. Skip this phase only if `noapply` argument was provided.

**Label IDs:** Use the Label IDs table from `triage-config.md`.

**Group emails by action** (same label + same archive/read behavior) and apply each group in a **separate, sequential** `batch_modify` call -- do NOT fire multiple `batch_modify` calls in parallel, as sibling-call failures cascade.

```
mcp__google_workspace__batch_modify_gmail_message_labels
  user_google_email: your-email@gmail.com
  message_ids: ["id1", "id2"]  # JSON array
  add_label_ids: ["YOUR_LABEL_ID"]  # from triage-config.md
  remove_label_ids: ["INBOX"]  # archive
```

**Retry on failure:** If a `batch_modify` call fails:
1. Wait -- do not immediately retry in the same parallel batch
2. Retry the **same call** once in a new, standalone tool invocation
3. If the retry also fails, fall back to **individual calls** -- one `batch_modify` per message ID
4. If individual calls also fail, log the failure and continue with remaining groups

Apply labels per the **Label application rules by routing tier** table in `triage-config.md`:

1. **@ToRead, @Announcements, @School, @Family, @FYI**: Add label, remove INBOX, leave UNREAD
2. **Expenses-Pending**: Add label, remove INBOX, mark as read
3. **Expenses-Personal**: Add label, remove INBOX, mark as read
4. **Expenses-Uncertain**: Add label, remove INBOX, leave UNREAD (you review in filtered view)
5. **Auto-Archive**: Add label, remove INBOX and UNREAD (marks as read)

For new filters, **call directly**:
```
mcp__google_workspace__create_gmail_filter
  user_google_email: your-email@gmail.com
  criteria: {"from": "sender@domain.com"}
  action: {"addLabelIds": ["<ID from triage-config.md>"], "removeLabelIds": ["INBOX"]}
```

**12b. Auto-create filters for high-confidence classifications:**

After applying labels, check if any classified sender meets ALL of these criteria:
- Exact sender match to a Classification Override entry, OR from a Newsletter Platform Domain, OR from a School Domain
- The override/domain entry has been in config for >7 days (not a brand-new addition)
- No existing Gmail filter already handles this sender (check `email-policy.md` Auto-Archive Filters)

If all criteria met: automatically create a Gmail filter using `create_gmail_filter`. Log it in the report:
```
AUTO-CREATED FILTERS: [N]
  - [sender@domain.com] -> [label] (was override/platform match, now permanent filter)
```
After creating the filter, note in report that the Classification Overrides entry can be removed from `triage-config.md` (do not auto-remove -- user confirms during review).

**12c. Clean inbox verification:**

After all labels are applied, run a verification query:
```
mcp__google_workspace__search_gmail_messages
  user_google_email: your-email@gmail.com
  query: "in:inbox is:unread"
  max_results: 5
```
Report the residual count:
```
INBOX HEALTH: [N] unread emails remain in inbox after triage
```
This is informational -- a rising count across runs signals the system is underperforming.

### Phase 13: Update Run State

After each successful label operation, append the message ID to `~/.claude-assistant/state/triage-run-state.json`. Also write a `last_run` ISO timestamp so the next run can auto-calculate the search window (see Phase 2). Format:
```json
{
  "last_run": "2026-02-15T08:30:00Z",
  "processed": [
    {"id": "msg_id_1", "label": "@ToRead", "ts": "2026-02-12T08:30:00Z"},
    {"id": "msg_id_2", "label": "Expenses-Pending", "ts": "2026-02-12T08:30:00Z"}
  ]
}
```
If the file exists, read it, append new entries, prune entries older than 7 days, and update `last_run` to the current time before writing back. If it does not exist, create it.

Report results:
```
LABELS APPLIED
==============
@ToRead: [N] emails
@Announcements: [N] emails
@School: [N] emails
Expenses-Pending: [N] emails
Expenses-Personal: [N] emails
Expenses-Uncertain: [N] emails
Auto-Archive: [N] emails

Total processed: [N]
Skipped: [N]
Deduped (from previous run): [N]
```

### Phase 14: Log Session

Append session summary to `~/.claude-assistant/logs/email-triage-observations.md`:

```
## Triage Session: [Date]

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Label-in-inbox sweep | [N] |
| Emails scanned | [N] |
| Deduped (previous run) | [N] |
| @ToRead applied | [N] |
| @Announcements applied | [N] |
| @School applied | [N] |
| Expenses-Pending applied | [N] |
| Auto-Archive applied | [N] |
| Filter bypass recovery | [N] |
| Auto-created filters | [N] |
| Skipped | [N] |
| Inbox residual (unread) | [N] |

### New filter suggestions:
- [suggestions if any]

### Corrections needed:
- [leave blank - user fills in after review]
```

Then log performance:
```bash
echo "$(date +%Y-%m-%d),triage-inbox,TOOL_CALLS,NOTES" >> ~/.claude-assistant/logs/skill-performance.csv
```
Replace TOOL_CALLS with your approximate count of tool uses this run. Replace NOTES with brief volume info (e.g., "22 emails scanned 8 labeled").

## Error Handling

- **Gmail MCP unavailable**: "Gmail integration unavailable. Try again later."
- **Batch modify fails**: Retry once standalone, then fall back to individual per-message calls (see Phase 12 retry logic). Report which emails failed, continue with others. Never fire multiple `batch_modify` calls in parallel.
- **Policy file not found**: Warn user to create config files from templates. Cannot proceed without at minimum `triage-config.md` (for label IDs).
- **Config file not found**: "Missing ~/.claude-assistant/config/triage-config.md. Download the template from the GitHub repo (see First-Time Setup)."

## Examples

```
/triage-inbox                    # Scan, report, and apply (default)
/triage-inbox noapply            # Preview only, do not apply
/triage-inbox days:14            # Scan last 14 days
/triage-inbox limit:20           # Process first 20 emails only
/triage-inbox days:30 limit:50   # 30 days, max 50 emails
```

## Integration with Weekly Workflow

- Runs daily (typically morning), sometimes multiple times/day
- Search window auto-adjusts: 1 day for daily runs, wider after gaps
- Use `days:N` to catch up after weekends or travel
- Most common senders should have permanent filters over time
- Skill catches new/unfamiliar senders that filters miss

## Feedback Loop

After each session, if corrections were made:
1. Add the sender to the **Classification Overrides** table in `triage-config.md` with the correct classification
2. Log the correction in `email-triage-observations.md` under the session's "Corrections needed" section
3. If the same sender has been overridden 2-3 times, create a permanent Gmail filter (move from overrides table to `email-policy.md` Auto-Archive Filters) and remove the override entry

**Override table hygiene (checked each run):** At the start of Phase 10, scan the Classification Overrides table for entries older than 14 days. Flag these in the report:
```
OVERRIDE TABLE AGING: [N] entries older than 14 days -- candidates for Gmail filter conversion
  - [sender] | added [date] | recommended filter: [label]
```
The overrides table should be a temporary holding pen, not a permanent rule store. Entries that persist >14 days should become Gmail filters.

## Customization Points

- **Label names and IDs** -- Edit `~/.claude-assistant/config/triage-config.md` to match your Gmail label structure. The skill uses whatever labels you define (you are not limited to the defaults listed here).
- **VIP / never-triage list** -- Edit `~/.claude-assistant/config/email-policy.md` to add people whose emails should never be auto-triaged.
- **Expense vendor domains** -- Add your expense vendors to `triage-config.md`. The skill routes receipts to expense labels automatically.
- **Classification score thresholds** -- Tune the scoring thresholds in `triage-config.md`. Higher thresholds = fewer false positives but more emails left in inbox. Lower = more aggressive triaging.
- **Classification overrides** -- Add specific senders to the overrides table in `triage-config.md` to bypass all scoring and always route them to a specific label.
- **School domains** -- If you are at a university, add your institution's email domains to the school domains list. Otherwise, remove the @School label and related logic.
- **Newsletter platform domains** -- Substack, Mailchimp, etc. Emails from these domains go straight to @ToRead.
- **Travel domains** -- The skill has built-in airline and hotel domain routing (Phase 8 area). Add or remove domains to match your travel patterns.
- **Search window defaults** -- Change the 7-day cap or 6-hour buffer in Phase 2 if you prefer different adaptive windows.
- **Gmail email address** -- Replace `your-email@gmail.com` in all MCP calls with your actual Gmail address.
- **Observation log location** -- Change the path in Phase 14 if you prefer a different log location.
- **Run state location** -- Change `~/.claude-assistant/state/triage-run-state.json` if you prefer a different state directory.
